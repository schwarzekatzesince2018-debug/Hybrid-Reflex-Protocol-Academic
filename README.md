## 📘 Overview

The **Hybrid Reflex Protocol (HRP)** is a *conceptual cognitive architecture* designed to coordinate multiple AI systems—LLMs, multimodal generators, evaluators, and creative agents—within a unified, reproducible creative reasoning workflow.

This repository provides the **Academic Edition**, which offers:

- a high-level explanation of HRP  
- layered cognitive modeling  
- the Reflex Loop conceptual model  
- optional noise/entropy analysis for research  
- diagrams and academic documentation (EN/JP)

No executable prompts, automation code, or system-level instructions are included.  
This edition is intended purely for academic, conceptual, and analytical use.

## 🧩 Architecture Summary

HRP models creative AI workflows using layered cognition:

- **Deep Layer** — theoretical reasoning, ethics, social logic  
- **Middle Layer** — language cognition, creative planning, persona cognition  
- **Surface Layer** — visual/audio concepts, final generative output

The architecture is model-agnostic and not tied to any specific AI system.

## 🔁 Reflex Loop (Conceptual Model)

HRP operates through a cyclic reasoning loop:

- Input Phase  
- Layer Processing  
- Output  
- Observation  
- Feedback  
- Consistency Filtering  

This loop enables structured refinement, creative variation, and stability analysis.

## 🎛 Optional Research Module: Noise & Entropy

HRP can incorporate noise/entropy as a *research mechanism* to analyze:

- creative variation  
- stylistic drift  
- stability under controlled perturbations  

Noise is **not required** for HRP operation but provides valuable insights for AI transparency and interpretability studies.

## 🧪 Research Context

HRP connects with several active research domains:

- AI transparency & interpretability  
- sparse circuits / functional decomposition  
- cognitive architectures  
- multi-agent reasoning  
- generative AI consistency & stability  

The structure makes HRP suitable as a *conceptual bridge* for analyzing  
large-model behavior in creative tasks.
